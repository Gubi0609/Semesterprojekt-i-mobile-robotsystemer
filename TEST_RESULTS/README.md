# Test Results

This directory contains test results and data collected from various tests.

Test results are committed to git so all team members can access and analyze them.

## Naming Convention
Test result files should follow this format:
- `<test_name>_<timestamp>.csv` for CSV data
- `<test_name>_<timestamp>.txt` for text output
- `<test_name>_<date>_<description>.md` for analysis/notes

## Notes
- Keep test results organized and documented
- Add a brief description when committing new results
- Large binary files (audio recordings, etc.) should NOT be committed - use .gitignore
