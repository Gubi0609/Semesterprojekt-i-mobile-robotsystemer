# Semesterprojekt-i-mobile-robotsystemer
This project focuses on creating a communication protocol with sound as the medium. One of the communicating devices is a TurtleBot with a Raspberry Pi 3 running ROS as it's brain.
We've decided to make a layered protocol, that focuses on short commands and error handling to ensure a stable and correct transfer of data.
